        <h2>Insidious</h2>
        <cite>(2011) 67.2%</cite>
      </div>
      <p>My first official movie review! Unfortunately, I'm starting off with a
        not-so-great film. I won't say it sucked, cause it had many redeeming features.
        But, some of it was just a bit too silly to be actually scary... but, I'm
        getting ahead of myself. I think I'll break it down into four sections, giving
        a rating out of 100% for each (and I expect to never give a full 100% to any
        movie in any category, unless it truly is flawless). Some minor spoilers below.</p>
      <h3>Plot - 82% for originality, 67% for substance</h3>
      <p>The plot had it's ups and downs. It was overall interesting, but in a few places
        kinda felt like it was grasping at straws. It was sort of a collection of random
        paranormal events, as if someone had wrote up a list, rolled a die twice, and
        ended up with "Astral Projection" and "Demonic Possession", and then figured
        out a way to connect the two. Also, some of it kinda felt like it was written
        by M. Night Shyamalan (namely the ending). As a fan of Oren Peli's Paranormal
        Activity, I was excited to see that he was involved, but it was only a producing
        role. I kinda feel like the movie would have ended up better if he had had more
        say in it, mainly in the little things. For instance, Oren Peli would have likely
        kept the demon in the shadows most of the time, instead of displaying him
        prominently like they did. I feel that's important for a horror movie: it's not
        what you see, but what you don't see that's truly terrifying.</p>
      <p>It was overall worth watching, but maybe if less people were involved
        in the production, it would have ended up feeling less eclectic (it had
        no less than five producers). Or, maybe it was the director, James Wan
        (of Saw fame), who, as shown in Saw, is not the best at showing true horror,
        and is at his best when he's making people squirm in discomfort at the
        ghastly images in his movies. They're calling this "The Scariest Movie
        since Poltergeist", but, while it wasn't entirely un-frightening, it wasn't
        even near as scary as Paranormal Activity. I'd hate to see Poltergeist...</p>
      <h3>Acting - 86%</h3>
      <p>Not the greatest acting ever, but that's to be expected. I mean, they
        didn't have the greatest actors ever. Rose Byrne (28 Weeks Later, Knowing)
        is as strong as ever, bringing realistic emotionality to the movie. Which
        is good, because she's opposite Patrick Wilson (Night Owl from Watchmen)
        who remains entirely unemotional, even as his son falls into a coma.
        Not to say that he's an entirely bad actor. Towards the end he shows
        himself to be a decent physical actor, and he plays the gallant if
        disbelieving husband well (which is to say, he can play a dick well...
        not necessarily a bad thing). To be honest, he's out-acted (albeit by
        a small margin) by the aforementioned son, played by Ty Simpkins.
        Towards the end of the movie, he manages to show some true terror (and
        in one part, be truly terrifying), which is a lot more than Patrick can
        say. I guess you could make the argument that he was being "stalwart",
        simply not allowing his fear to get the better of him. But, showing some
        of it, at some point, would have helped.</p>
      <p>Lin Shaye (the Landlady from Kingpin) came into the scene late as the
        psychic character with all the answers. She managed to be creepy, and
        used her facial expressions to do most of her acting (most of her lines
        were half-whispers). It worked, but it seems like there are much better
        people who could have filled that role.</p>
      <p>The main demon (played by the guy who did the music for Repo! The
        Genetic Opera) was excellent, acted as well as can be expected, and
        with a truly terrifying appearance (more on that in the "Visual Effects"
        section). The rest of the "entities" not so much. Most were kinda
        awkward, seeming more like zombies than ghosts. The ones featured
        prominently, the "Dolls" and the "Long Haired Fiend" as they're referred
        to by the producers, were good enough (the "Dolls" managing to be
        especially creepy in their major scene). But, most of the extra ghosts
        were just that: extra. Here meaning "Unnecessary."</p>
      <p>A note about the writing: The conversations were written in an attempt
        at a realistic style, with Patrick's character even stumbling over words
        as if not sure what to say... I applaud them for the attempt, but if
        you're going to do that, you have to use some actors with some
        improvisational skill, which Patrick Wilson simply doesn't have.
        And, it's somehow made even more awkward by how impressively good
        Rose Byrne is. Her acting really carried the movie, and in fact she
        is pretty much the main character for the entire first and second act,
        with the focus shifting to Patrick towards the end.</p>
      <h3>Visual Effects - 87%</h3>
      <p>I gotta hand it to them, they really pulled off all the looks they were
        going for. They must have spent a fortune (and hours upon hours) on all
        that makeup. The demon, as mentioned, was terrifying. The deep red of his
        face, and the pitch black of the rest of him came together for a quite
        striking effect, accentuated by the bright yellow of his eyes. That said,
        it was very slightly too cartoony to keep you up at night.</p>
      <p>The overall general style was great, but there were one or two glaring
        exceptions. Watch out for Lin Shaye in a gigantic gas mask, which
        looked quite silly to be honest. Also, there were two techies with
        some sort of paranormal monitoring equipment that looked kinda silly,
        with random things sticking off in random directions, as if in an
        attempt to make them more sci-fi looking. Honestly, as you can tell
        by the fact that I didn't even mention them in the "Acting" section,
        those characters felt out of place and pointless, just like their
        equipment.</p>
      <h3>Soundtrack - 14%</h3>
      <p>Holy hell the god-awful noises they made in this movie! At one point
        I swear to god they used the noise of someone beating a piano with a
        baseball bat as a soundtrack. I shit you not. Later, it sounded like
        one of the violins (which was already making that horrible buzzing
        racket they use in a lot of horror movies) broke a string, and they
        just left it in. Guess they liked the effect. It made me want to go
        take all of their instruments and give them to 8 year old children,
        who could play them much better. It was horrible. But, it had those
        few random moments when the effect worked to their favor (mainly the
        "beating a piano with a baseball bat" at the exact moment something
        jumped out of a cupboard), hence the "14%" rather than a "1%" (0% is
        no soundtrack at all...).</p>
      <h3>Overall - 67.2% (Average of the above)</h3>
      <p>It was a fairly decent movie. It wasn't a "God, why did I just waste
        two hours of my life on that drivel?" type of movie. It was worth
        watching... I'll probably never watch it again though. It wasn't scary
        enough to be a horror movie, it wasn't suspenseful enough to be a
        suspense movie, and it wasn't thrilling enough to be a thriller. So,
        that leaves it being just another Paranormal movie, which, while not a
        bad thing, isn't good enough.</p>
      <p>Thus concludes my first in-depth review of a movie. I hope it was
        educational for y'all. I know it was for me... for instance: did you
        know it takes nearly an hour to write 1,300 words at 4:00 in the
        morning? You do now, and so do I. I'm gonna go pass out before I do
        it right here. See ya next time, until then ::insert random sign-off
        that includes a reference to "Bottomless Thought"::</p>
      <p>(One of these days, I'll actually have to think of one of those...)</p>

        <h2>Red Riding Hood</h2>
        <cite>(2011) 72%</cite>
      </div>
      <p>As always, there may be minor spoilers below.</p>
      <h3>Plot - 64% for originality, 84% for substance</h3>
      <p>I had to give it a low score for originality, it being based on one of the oldest still surviving stories out there. As a general rule, I think I'm going to make 75% the highest score a remake can get for originality. So, that means that 64%
        is actually a pretty decent score, and it deserves it. It took that old tale and made it into an original feeling movie. It's a pretty hard thing to do, to take an old story like that, and make it into a movie that actually kept me guessing
        until the end. Just when you were certain who the werewolf was, that person either died, or was proved without a doubt to be the wrong person. They even managed to do this multiple times without it seeming exhausting, keeping up the feeling
        of mystery throughout.</p>
      <p>The plot begins, and ends, as a romance. It never really becomes the action-ish movie that it seems like it might be starting to become at a few points, keeping the pace slow, but bearable. That said, the dominate genre would have to be
        "murder-mystery" in my (not so humble) opinion (for the record, it's officially [here meaning, "by wikipedia"] being called an "Epic Fantasy" which it most certainly is not), a genre which works well for the story.</p>
      <p>Some of the time, it feels like they're trying way too hard to make you think the werewolf is definitely this person or that person. I felt like it could have used more time during the second act, where the werewolf could be almost anyone,
        or at least a larger group of people. Without spoiling anything, a clue is given very early on about who it could be, almost immediately narrowing the list of suspects to four or five people. Before that, it could have been anyone in the
        town, or even the main character, and I felt it could have used a little more time to let that sink in, to let you naturally suspect whichever character you personally didn't like. To formulate your own ideas, before it started making up your
        mind for you.</p>
      <p>I'd have to say, one of my biggest problems with the plot of the movie is the beginning. Or, really, just the way the characters are introduced, or, should I say, not introduced at all. The beginning of the movie is just this barrage of
        different names, and you're trying to keep up, create a couple of family trees in your head to keep track of things, but at first it's just too much. I honestly feel like I missed a couple of the early plot points because of this, figuring
        out what they meant later on in the movie. I honestly don't know how they could have remedied this, but... I don't know, it feels like they could have spent a bit more time at the beginning. I mean, shit, the movie is only an hour-and-a-half
        long. They could have added an extra ten minutes to the beginning and ten minutes to the middle, fleshed out their characters, made their mystery slightly more engaging. Again, I don't really know what they would have added in this time, but
        a good filmmaker could have found something.</p>
      <h3>Acting - 85%</h3>
      <p>The voluptuous Amanda Seyfried (the geeky chick from Jennifer's Body) stars as Valerie, the girl with the titular Red Riding Hood. Her (and her gigantic... eyes lol) put in a great performance, managing lust, sadness, anger... but, no real
        fear to speak of. Perhaps that was just a choice for her character, but, even with a wolf staring her right in the face, she appeared almost... calm, collected. I guess it does somewhat make sense for the character, but at the same time, it
        came off as somewhat awkward. Her main love interest is Shiloh Fernandez (a virtual nobody, having mainly TV roles), who plays Peter, the stoic woodcutter. He does well, at least in the scenes where he's supposed to be showing his love for
        Valerie (though one scene was all lust... he looked like he was about to ruin that girl. lol), but who couldn't, really? (Ok, I'll stop making references about how hot Amanda Seyfried is...) Of course, that's 90% of his screen time, the rest
        being scenes of him standing around, looking all mysterious (or, trying to look all mysterious anyway), or else arguing with Max Irons' (another nobody) character, Henry, the guy who Valerie has been arranged to marry. Max Irons has much less
        experience as an actor than Shiloh, but acts circles around him, showing true compassion for Valerie, and appears truly defeated when Valerie reveals that she is in love with Peter, and doesn't want to marry him. All in all, he's definitely
        the third best actor in the film, which actually is saying something in a film with so many different random actors.</p>
      <p>Speaking of which, I was surprised to see Gary Oldman (you don't need me to tell you what he was from) show up as Father Solomon, the priest and hunter of the supernatural. He puts in his usual stellar performance, even working with a script
        that's a little beneath him. Though, even he isn't immune to my nitpicking, and I have to say, he proved himself to be a somewhat inept physical actor in this film. Most of it was just post-production problems, and could have been solved with
        a decent editor, but some of it was... well, kinda awkward. My biggest complaint was with his showdown with the werewolf. He seemed to just be wildly swinging his silver sword, with no real skill or technique. One could argue that he's
        getting too old for that shit, and I would agree... which is why he shouldn't have done it; used a stunt actor, or asked them to find a different way to work that scene.</p>
      <p>SPOILERS AHEAD.</p>
      <p>Another problem I had with his performance was his death. It was awkward. He didn't look dead, he looked like he twitched and then stared off into space for a moment. Again, some of that is a post-production problem, they should have
        "deadened" his eyes a bit, maybe paled his face a bit. But, mostly, it was him.</p>
      <p>END SPOILERS.</p>
      <p>I hate to kinda pick on him, but he's Gary Fucking Oldman. I expect better. One could make the excuse that he probably didn't care too much about this movie, so probably didn't give it his full attention. I mean, even great actors have to
        make a living, and his last movie was Book of Eli, in January of last year (not counting his very, very small role in Deathly Hallows Part 2). But still... I expect better.</p>
      <p>Billy Burke (Charlie Swan in The Twilight Saga, a.k.a. the Best Actor in the Twilight Series) plays Valerie's father, and puts in a fine performance on this, bringing believability to an otherwise slightly off movie.</p>
      <p>Other than that Virginia Madsen (The Number 23, The Astronaut Farmer) plays Valerie's mother, in a forgettable role, and Julie Christie (Madam Rosmerta from Harry Potter, also Troy) plays Valerie's grandmother, who is at once creepy and the
        warm, motherly type (like most Grandmas lol). You may also recognize Lukas Haas from Inception, the chemical guy at the beginning, who plays Father Auguste, putting in a fine performance himself.</p>
      <h3>Visual Effects - 52%</h3>
      <p>First and foremost, the "snow" that constantly covered the ground in this movie was obviously fake. I thought it looked like large-grain salt or something like that. It didn't fall right, it didn't scatter right, it didn't make prints right.
        It was just wrong.</p>
      <p>Also, I'm pretty sure they just took the one of the wolves from Twilight and pasted it into this movie. And then went and rendered it shitily. Not that it looked entirely horrible, per se, but it was entirely unoriginal, and it was way too
        obviously CG. No possibility for suspension of disbelief. I have to admit, though, that I am spoiled on great graphics, but I thought we had come beyond things that looked that obviously fake.</p>
      <p>The setting of the movie was the town of "Daggerhorn", which, first of all, sounds like it came straight out of World of Warcraft, but, second of all, every building in Daggerhorn was made of gigantic spiky logs, the kind you usually see
        lining the trenches of old-time swords and spears warfare movies like The Thirteenth Warrior. That place is a fuckin deathtrap. Slip and fall at any point, and you've just been impaled on a, no shit, two foot spike. It was kinda ridiculous. I
        get it, really I do, it was supposed to represent the fact that the town had been plagued by this werewolf for generations, and thus had to defend itself. But, the way this town is set up, you are much, much more likely to be killed at the
        local tavern than you are by any werewolf, especially considering that, at the beginning of the movie they mention that the werewolf hasn't killed anyone in twenty years. I mean, yeah, maybe that's only true because of the massive amounts of
        defenses, but still... a single, or even a couple, deaths every full moon is worth it when the alternative is gruesome, agonizing death at any moment.</p>
      <h3>Soundtrack - 75%</h3>
      <p>To be honest, I'm giving this score somewhat arbitrarily, as I didn't really notice the score. It was your generic movie score, to be honest. It set the mood, and otherwise stayed in the background. I decided on 75%, rather than the 50% I
        was planning on giving it because, while it was completely average, not standing out in any way, it did what it was meant to do, which is set the mood of the scenes in the movie. A decent score can do one of two things, stand out or blend in.
        This one blended in.</p>
      <h3>Overall - 72% (Average of the above)</h3>
      <p>Some of what happens really doesn't make a lot of sense, in retrospect. It won't be near as good the second time around, not that it was really good enough the first time to want to watch over and over again. That said, it was worth
        watching, and I wouldn't not want to watch it again. If someone hadn't seen it (preferably a female who's not my mom) I would sit and watch it with them.
        This is definitely more of a chick flick, but guys will enjoy it as well. So guys, rent it and watch it with your girl, before she rents it and makes you watch it anyway.

        <h2>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</h2>
        <cite>(2011) 84.4%</cite>
      </div>
      <p>As always, there may be minor spoilers below.</p>
      <h3>Plot - 85% for originality, 92% for substance</h3>
      <p>What can I really say? It was great. The setup was nearly flawless. Dude testing Alzheimer drug on chimps, chimp goes crazy, they scrap the project and put down all the chimps. One chimp that was on the medication ends up being pregnant, the
        baby chimp lives, scientist takes it home with him, and the medication passes through the blood. Caesar, as this chimp is named, is smart. Really smart. Smarter than human children at his age.</p>
      <p>It goes over some technical stuff at points, but actually makes it interesting. The movie never really loses that feeling of complete engagement, even in the slower parts, of which there were few to begin with. At first I felt like they
        might be rushing things a bit, but that was just their hook, and it was extremely effective. The pace was fast, but they had a lot of ground to cover, and it never felt exhausting; never felt like you couldn't keep up. At the same time, they
        managed to cover a lot of ground without the movie dragging at any point. Basically, flawless pacing.</p>
      <p>The action was handled extremely well. I hate it when movies are all over the place, and the camera's shaking so much, you can barely follow what's going on. None of that here. It felt like every shot was planned out to get across exactly
        what it needed to, which was usually that these apes were faster, stronger, smarter, and more united than the humans they fought against.</p>
      <p>By the way, this is officially being called a reboot, meaning it has nothing to do with 2001's Planet of the Apes, which sort of implies that there will likely be a sequel. It certainly made enough money to do so, making almost $20 million
        at the box office so far. Of course, on a $90 million movie, they better make a bit more than that over the next couple weeks.</p>
      <h3>Acting - 79%</h3>
      <p>James Franco (Spiderman, Your Highness, and Oz in the upcoming Oz: the Great and Powerful) plays Will Rodman (I actually found out his name just now, looking it up; they don't say it much in the movie), the aforementioned scientist. He did
        well, but it seemed like kind of an awkward role for him. It's not that he can't be smart, it's just that he doesn't look the scientist part. Of course, it's better than Tobey McGuire, who they wanted for the role, but (thankfully)
        negotiations on that fell through. As I said, he did well, though, showing true compassion for Caesar, which must have been difficult as Caesar was entirely CG. Caesar's part was done by Andy Serkis (Gollum from The Lord of the Rings),
        although I'm not really sure exactly how much he did for the role. Mostly face capture stuff, probably. It was done well; you could tell pretty much tell exactly what Caesar was thinking at all times. He had a "pissed off face" that would
        strike fear into the soul of the most stoic of men.</p>
      <p>Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire, which I've never seen, and the upcoming Immortals) plays the obligatory love interest, an essentially unnecessary role. She did well with what she was given though.</p>
      <p>Tom Felton (Draco) plays the guard at this place that is essentially a prison for apes. He plays the same kind of douchebag as Draco, making one wonder if he'll be stuck in that role for the rest of his career. He plays it well, giving
        Caesar good reason to revolt against the humans.</p>
      <p>John Lithgow (3rd Rock from the Sun, Dexter, and also apparently a musician... I didn't know that) plays Will's father. He has Alzheimers, and so is the driving force behind Will's search for a "cure". He plays the clueless Alzheimers
        patient flawlessly. Some of the time I really wasn't certain if he actually knew what was going on. As usual, he was brilliant.</p>
      <p>Brian Cox (William Stryker in X-men, and countless other random roles) plays the owner of the aforementioned ape prison, playing the slimy businessman type, who it is implied has some dark history with apes. Or maybe that's just Brian,
        bringing an intensity to the role that's really kinda unnecessary. He does that.</p>
      <h3>Visual Effects - 91%</h3>
      <p>The ape effects were superb. While you could tell it was CG, it was done with a subtlety and nuance that is rarely seen in that kind of work. The intelligent apes looked intelligent, you could just see it in their eyes. And the dumb apes
        just looked... well, like apes. It was really the display of emotion that got me. You could tell when the apes were pissed off (which was most of the time), but you could also see happiness, sadness, regret, really the entire spectrum of
        human emotions. Quite amazing to see on the face of a CG ape (for those of you that are curious, the difference between a monkey and an ape is a tail. Apes have no tails, thus these are apes, not monkeys).</p>
      <p>There is an intense final scene that takes place on the Golden Gate bridge, and it is completely covered in fog. This entire scene was shot flawlessly, with intense special effects, including that of a chopper going down. All of this was
        done so well, it really felt almost real. I mean, movie real... you know what I mean.</p>
      <p>All in all, just really a great looking film.</p>
      <h3>Soundtrack - 77%</h3>
      <p>Again, just like the Red Riding Hood one, the music was blended into the background. Non-important, just a set piece. Things that don't stand out can't be considered great. So, I give this 75%, because I'm sure the music was done well, but I
        didn't notice.</p>
        <p>Of note, though, is a part where John Lithgow plays the piano. That dude is really damn good. Actually, you know what, I think I'm gonna add another 2% based on that, cause not only did he play the piano, it was actually part of the story.
        When he played with Alzheimers, it was horrible, and when he played without, it was awesome. (That sentence will make a lot more sense when you see the movie).</p>
      <h3>Overall - 84.4% (Average of the above)</h3>
      <p>All in all, a must see movie. I can see how people could consider some parts kinda awkward (a lot of people even laughed at the theater during one inappropriate moment in particular right at the end; I'm sure you'll be able to tell which one
        that is), but I found the suspension of disbelief to be flawless, the pacing superb, and basically the entire idea of the movie awesome.
        The moral of the story: If you're a douchebag, apes will take over the planet.</p>

      <p>Long-time readers may notice that I have changed the format ever so slightly, putting the acting before the plot. I felt this made more sense: this way I can introduce the characters and then explain how they interact. Also, I'm gonna start putting the Overall percentage in the title, and will go back and do this to previous ones as well. This is the way I will be doing it from here on out. Deal with it. Or don't. lol</p>
      <p>As always, there may be minor spoilers below.</p>
      <h3>Acting - 91%</h3>
      <p>Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, The Prestige) stars as Charlie Keaton, a terrible father, generally an asshole, and all around horrible person. At least at the beginning of the movie. By the end, you can take off the "terrible father" part, and downgrade the "horrible person" to "not-so-great dude".  But, more about that in the plot section. Hugh, as always, performed admirably, perhaps even better than usual. There was real depth to his character; you really got the feel that this guy was an asshole because the world made him that way, but also because he's just too stubborn to quit. But, as nuanced a performance he put in, he was still upstaged by an 11-year-old kid.</p>
      <p>Dakota Goyo (Young Thor in Thor, also in Defendor apparently, but I don't remember it, probably a nearly non-existent role) plays Max Keaton, Charlie's son who he hasn't seen since his birth. This kid has spirit. He plays off of Hugh's assholish stubbornness, and throws it back in spades. He's a foul-mouthed, stubborn, cocky little kid, a kid who knows what he wants, and will do what it takes to get it. And Goyo pulls it all off like he's used to hyping up crowds, challenging gigantic robots to fights, all the while making thousands of dollars... Well, he might actually be used to that last part by now...</p>
      <p>Evangeline Lilly (who some of you know from Lost, but I certainly don't... I can't start watching that show, or it will suck me in... Also, she's to play an elf in the upcoming The Hobbit, which should be awkward, as she looks exactly like Liv Tyler) plays the obligatory love interest, but it doesn't feel like a role simply thrown in to tap the female audience. Bailey Tallet is the daughter of some great boxer or another, the man who trained Charlie. They've known each other their entire lives, and there is an implied on-and-off-again relationship between them. But, it goes beyond that. She acts as Charlies conscience (which is good, because he clearly doesn't have one), and is also his tech expert. She fixes the Robots after he's done destroying them and making very little money off of it. She plays the role well, if a bit over-emotionally for someone who has had to put up with this jackass her entire life.</p>
      <p>(EDIT: Ugh.. I wrote this? Really? Must have been really late... I apologize for the awkward sentence structure and bad word usage, but I can't in good journalistic integrity go back and change my opinion...)</p>
<p>Other honorable mentions include Kevin Durand (Fred Dukes aka "The Blob" in Wolverine, and the Mogadorian Commander in I am Number Four), who plays some cowboy dude charlie owes money to. He was weird as usual. Anthony Mackie (The dude who helps the main characters in Adjustment Bureau, a movie I need to do a review of, because it was awesome, and more people should know it) plays a dude taking bets during the big events. He's just some cool random black dude. Phil LaMarr (MadTv, Pulp Fiction) plays an announcer dude. Blink and you'll miss him. Just had to add that cause Phil LaMarr is awesome.</p>
<p>Wikipedia also lists Audrey Bitoni, the porn star, as playing someone named "Laura Daily" but for the life of me I cannot remember a character by that name in the film, or even any characters that might fit. So, that may or may not be true. Either way, pretty funny.</p>
      <h3>Plot - 82% for originality, 87% for substance</h3>
      <p>The premise was simple; Robot fighting matches have replaced real boxing sometime in the future. It never tells exactly when in the future, or when boxing became popular again after it's recent overtaking by MMA, but you can ignore things like that, because underlying the simple premise is the much more complicated subject of the relationship between father and son. Max comes back into Charlies life after the mysterious death of his mother. Ok, so it's not mysterious, it just never says exactly how it happened (which actually leads to a somewhat awkward line of dialogue later in the film by Jackman). Charlie never wanted to be a father, and makes this very clear when he asks the extremely rich husband of Max's Aunt (next-of-kin) for $100,000 in exchange for letting them adopt the kid (the other option being orphanage and, hopefully, foster home). Charlie (for reasons that aren't really clear) decides to keep the kid for the summer. Charlie soon realizes that this kid knows all about Robot Fighting, and they end up traveling together, get a new robot, and start winning matches.</p>
      <p>Throughout the movie, Charlie changes. He realizes that he loves his son, and genuinely changes. But, it isn't the usual Hollywood, "I used to be an asshole but now I'm the nicest person in the world" (or "The Scrooge Effect"). This is a change from assholish terrible father to assholish somewhat decent dad, played in a way that feels authentic.</p>
      <p>The dialogue is well-written, the movie paced flawlessly, never floundering, but never moving too fast. I had to subtract a bit though, because there is very little revealed in the way of back story. There's too much left to, eh, they'll figure it out. Like I said, it never says the date (only mentioning the year 2016 at one point as if it was sometime in the past. So, the best estimate I can make is, "after 2017"), you never see Max's mom, or find out how she died. There's no explanation of the technology of the time, and there's all the little things that are left unexplained. Character motivations and things like that. (I'll be honest, I started that last paragraph with a mind to build up to some certain point, but now I, for the life of me, cannot remember what it was... there was something that bugged me that they didn't explain though...)</p>
      <h3>Visual Effects - 90%</h3>
      <p>Not a lot to say, really. These were Robots. Fighting. It looked exactly like it would if you actually built these Robots with a mind to move like a person and trained them to box. Really, just spot on, realistic stuff. The only thing I can criticize is the motion-blur effect. When the robots got moving really quickly, they blurred a bit, like a person would moving at those speeds... except that this looked more like a pixelated blur than an actual motion blur. But, I cant be too pissed about that, there just simply hasn't been an algorithm written yet that does that well.
They apparently used the same motion capture technology they used in Avatar for the robot fights. They must have used well-trained boxers, because these things moved like champions.
Apparently Sugar Ray Leonard (not to be confused with the band Sugar Ray, who did that awesome 90s anthem "Fly") was the boxing consultant, teaching Hugh Jackman quite a bit about the art. I gotta say, Hugh is a surprisingly great boxer. He moves flawlessly. And, after the forty or so pounds of muscle he put on for Wolverine, he's now definitely not someone you wanna mess with.
</p>
      <h3>Soundtrack - 72%</h3>
      <p>I gave it the usual 75% for a soundtrack that I didn't really notice most of the time, but then subtracted 3% for gratuitous use of Eminem. All of that is really weird when you consider that the score was done by Danny Elfman, a man who couldn't blend in if he tried, and who should never in any way be associated with Eminem.</p>
<p>That's really all I have to say on that, though. The music was appropriate (and the opening song was pretty decent, though I don't remember what it was), and that's about it.</p>
      <h3>Overall - 84.4% (Average of the above)</h3>
      <p>Generally a very decent movie, one I would recommend for anyone. Go see it, you wont be disappointed.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I had very very low expectations of this movie. "Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots: The Movie?" I thought, "There's no way that can be anything but a steaming pile of crap with crap sauce and a side of shit." (This was right before I thought, "Y'know, maybe I read too many Cracked articles...") But, I was pleasantly surprised, and I am rarely this happy to have been proven wrong. Though, I wasn't wrong about the Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots: The Movie part. Cause that's still totally what this was. There was even a part that had to be in homage to those old plastic robots, during one of the fight scenes. But, you'll see it for yourself...</p>
